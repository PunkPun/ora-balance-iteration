# Change Log

The rationale behind the changes in each release is given in this file, along with
comments from players to back it up.


## 3.2

### Phase Transport uncloak on load

Phase Transport uncloaks on load as well as unload.

* TTTPPP -- 2021/09/16: It would be another (small) nerf to the PT, but would hopefully make then less annoying
* SarahSicaria -- 2021/09/16: I think its ok
* upps -- 2021/09/16: I think thats fair, reduce the cloak time by a bit and im up for that.
* i like men -- 2021/09/16: I'm okay with either. I do not think it will have an impact in 1vs1 but can see it being a good change for teamgames

### Bug Fixes

* Spies disguised as Tanya now have the skull icon.

## 3.1

### Mechanics (back to default)

Remove mechanic and most of the husk changes (husks are still restored to 15% though). There were various views on this, but the main issue was that it allowed stealing an allied husk to gain double tech in team games.

* .won -- 2021/08/16: Is there a way to stop the time out of a husk on cap starting? I tried to cap a husk and the timer just went to 0 so I couldn't
* SarahSicaria -- 2021/08/24: 16 seconds would make it near impossible to capture any husk. thats way too long. even 8 seconds is a lot

### Flame Towers can aim while being built

This avoid flame towers missing with their first shot.

### GPS charge time 4 minutes (previously 8 minutes), reveals for 1 minute (previously no limit)

Allies on T3 were previously incentivised to turtle for 8 minutes and then they got an almost game-breakingingly good support power. This aims to reduce the benefit of turtling, while still providing the option to deploy GPS to prepare for an attack.

Created by Pinkthoth.

### Medium Tanks (back to default)

By increasing the price we were pushing MTs closer to HTs. Reverting the small change to try to keep them distinct.

### Tanya

Add skull icon to make it slightly easier to snipe Tanya.

Created by Darkademic

* upps -- 2021/01/12: Tanya is fine in general... A detection help like a hero symbol for everyone ingame in vision range would be helpful too.
* Blackened -- 2021/09/07: idk if its been talked about but a commando icon would go a long way with nerfing tanya without actually nerfing her.
* Longely -- 2021/09/07: yeah that is a great idea
* dang_shot -- 2021/09/09: tanya is still strong i think. i have several games with nerfed tanya winning game for me
* Unano -- 20221/09/22: Skull idea sounds interesting but i dont think it goes far enough personally. The problem isnt spotting tanya, its the fact that a t1.5 - early t2 blob cant get near her to even try to kill her before she kills so much. And the fact she can be churned out so easily to go again

Against:

* happy -- 2021/09/09: thats one of the two parts that made tanya good, does this blob have tanya in? and can i get a snipe off before she kills me. which was easily achieved before adding an icon to her. but now as soon as you have vision yes tanyas there run ez

### Airfield ACC 1.0

Add second exit for slight improvement to left/right balance.

### Bug Fixes

Iron Curtain - Fix hit box and selection box.

## 3.0

Initial release.

### Mechanics

* Mechanics now take 16 seconds to capture husks and cost 400 (down from 500), 
* Husks are restored with 15% health (down from 25%)

Mechanics were being built after husks appeared and were hardly ever used for repairing damaged tanks on the battlefield. The low risk for restoring husks could cause Allies to snowball. Conversely they were a risky unit to keep in a blob. More data supporting this change is given based on RAGL Season 10 data: https://forum.openra.net/viewtopic.php?p=313241#p313241

### Medium Tank cost 900 (up from 850)

Slight nerf as MTs were performing slightly better than HTs.

### Demo truck health 2800 (down from 5000), speed 75 (down from 85)

### Tanya cost 1500 (up from 1200)

Sniping Tanya had a very small impact because she could be rebuilt very quickly.

Feedback:

* happy -- 2021/09/07 from what ive played so far she already seems nerfed enough
* .won -- 2021/09/07 although i do agree with happy i think tanya is in a pretty good spot. especially in the BI

### Mine health 5000 (down from 10000)

The aim is to make it easier to sweep a minefield.

### MGG has deployable shroud

The MGG generally acted as a reverse GPS - allowing the opponent to track a blob through the fog of war.

### Parabomb rework

They now come from a single badger (down from 3), with health 40000 (up from 30000) and 10 bombs (up from 5)
Each bomb has range 6c0 (up from 3c0), fall speed 50 (up from 40), spread 1000 (up from 768), damage vs none 40 (up from 30) and vs wood 60 (up from 30)

* Pun -- 2021/09/13 as for parabombs, I just though it would be better if there was a clear way to dodge them, this change also nerfs map edge performance. The slow bombs weren't cutting it

### Mig health 8000 (down from 10000)

### Dog chew time 20 (down from 45), jump 3c0 (up from 2c0)

Small buff to the dog attack, although it's expected they'll still mainly be used for vision.

### SAM missile max range 11c0 (up from 9c0)

Often missiles explode before reaching their target. By increasing the max range then players will have to be more careful not to fly near to SAM sites.

* memers.club -- 2021/07/21: The SAM site is crap compared to all other options IMO
* .won -- 2021/07/21: I also think currently the SAM is a bit shit, defs the worst of all AA options
* poop -- 2021/07/21: i always thought sam sites fukin sucked

Against:

* Pun -- 2021/07/21: SAM currently is ridiculously good, it just can't handle MiGs. Like the only reason you dont build them is because flaks are mobile and sams are not

### Iron Curtain footprint is now 2x2 (up from 2x1) and duration is 400 ticks (down from 500)

Previously it was possible to hide a SAM site or missile silo behind the IC. The new footprint prevents this and also matches the Chronosphere.

For:

* goat -- 2021/09/22: just here to say that i think the ic change is really good
* i like men -- 2021/09/22: I thought the IC nerf was the best change actually hehe. Was not aware some were opposed to it

Against:

* SarahSicaria -- 2021/09/21: Not sure why this is being nerfed, the IC is in a perfect spot imo. If the IC really must be nerfed, increasing the recharge time would be better, not decreasing the effect duration
* Major Kusanagi Motoko -- 2021/09/21 +1. this suggestion makes more sense. The effect duration is already moderately short, while the cooldown of 2 mins is rather quick.

### Modified production queue timings (except vehicles): 100, 86, 75, 67, 60, 55, 50 (rather than 100, 85, 75, 65, 60, 55, 50)

### Ranger speed 160 (down from 170), vision 7c0 (down from 8c0)

Included from RATL/S10 balance.

### Radar Dome cost 1500 (down from 1800)

Included from RATL/S10 balance.

### Longbow anti-ground reload delay 34 (up from 30), burst delay 10 (up from 7)

Included from RATL/S10 balance.

### Phase Transport uncloak on unload

This is to fix a bug introduced in the release.
