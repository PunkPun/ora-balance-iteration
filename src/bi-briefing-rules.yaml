The map pick process should take the following order:\n    * Second player bans a map;\n    * First player picks a different map;\n    * First game is played;\n    * First player bans a map;\n    * Second player picks a map excluding the two banned maps and the map used for the first game;\n    * Second game is played.\n    Players are free to make exceptions from this rule at the discretion of both parties.\n  4.1.10 All players must be authenticated for their games. Games featuring anonymous players may need to be replayed. It is recommended to play on servers that require authentication to avoid this situation.\n\nGood luck commanders!
