# BI-4.0 Planning

Discussion about balance going into BI-4.0.


## General

### Scaling

* dang_shot - 2022-06-02: the scaling changes, i dont want to list specific numbers but i think we could touch scaling too

### Bullet Speed

* i like men - 2022-06-02: I would definitely not add bullet speed to rifles. I don't think it would improve any interactions and I think it would be rather annoying
* dang_shot - 2022-06-02: bullet speed for rifles would not be good with how movement and subcell works. if damage is consistent in infantry vs infantry, then i think i would be fine with testing it now we have the facing changes
* Longley - 2022-06-02: i wasnt planning to add it to anything, since it would be very controversial. but its no secret im not a fan of the bullet speed removal

### Crushing

* Pinkthoth - 2022-06-02: I think RA would benefit from including CA's feature where vehicles slow down when they are crushing infantry
* Blackened - 2022-06-02: I'd be okay with that but maybe not such a hard slowdown
* Duke Bones - 2022-06-02: But what about those NASTY early game LV crushes smh
* Gacius - 2022-06-02: that is annoying and shouldnt exist
* tux - 2022-06-02: I hate thohse. complete rng
* Pun - 2022-06-27: Add a significant slowdown on crushes and make crush rate 100%
* Longley - 2022-06-27: i tested the oposite 100% dodge chance, i think something like what you suggest here should probably be tested separately since it really affects everything else


## Defences

### Base Defences

* dang_shot - 2022-06-02: i dont think base defences have been that dominant this season (but maybe players disagree?), but i still think pill box is overperforming a little. Punsho tested a pretty big increase in reload delay some time back and seemed like it worked pretty well, so i think we should nerf pill box a little by increasing reload delay
* i like men - 2022-06-02: adding a new armor type for base defences. I know back then Pun made the argument that it would probably be better for us to work with what we already had and I don't disagree with that, but seeing as TD has now done it too I actually think we should really consider doing it here as well becuase it does give us more freedom
* dang_shot - 2022-06-02: oo thats a good one. i really think we should do that now td has done it too
* Pun - 2022-06-02: Before changing their armour type, we should consider what do we actually want to do with it. I can think of only 2 potentially worthwhile changes: tanks do less damage to defences. aircraft do less damage to defences. well, another one could be a big reduction to anti-inf defence damage, and also reduction in rocket soldier damage to defences. When it comes to artillery I do think arty needs to have a bit higher anti-defence damage. But that change doesn't require a new armour type at all
* Upps - 2022-06-02: About adding concrete Armor for defences im a fan of that. -making tanks a lot better against defences. -making BH/Yak a lot worse against defences. I would exclude Migs and Longbows for this. -making rocket Soldier worse to defences.

### Gap Generator

* Pun - 2022-06-02: I think gap generation could receive a +1 cell range buff


## Infantry

### Rockets

* Moods - 2022-06-28: i suggested making the allies rocketman unique in the sense that it gets longer AA range.
* SarahSicaria - 2022-06-28: I think the rocket soldier should stay universal. It still wouldn't be viable as they are really slow

### Flamers

* i like men - 2022-06-02: It's no secret that I wanted to rework flamer or grenadier, but seeing how well despro has been using flamers I would kind of just like to leave them alone for now
* Longely - 2022-06-02: yeah, i was actually planning to rework the flammer a bit. but despro kinda proved they allready are pretty usefull in the cases i wanted it to be good in.

### Grenadiers

* tux - 2022-06-02: oh yeah how about removing chain explosions from grens
* Gacius - 2022-06-03: if dog ate a grenadier, should dog explode as well from death damage of gren?
* Pun - 2022-06-03: I'm not sure what grenades you've seen people eat, but they defo shouldn't detonate

### Dogs

* dang_shot - 2022-06-30: keep in mind widow also asked about dogs and mammoths (i think both are fine, but could maybe do something with dogs if you want to)
* despro - 2022-06-30: theyre fine imo
* i like men - 2022-06-30: Anyway dogs seem fine to me but to be perfectly honest I haven't seen that much of them so I can't comment too much on them. I did see that they were not used that much in RAGL though but that does not necessarily mean they suck, I guess they are just rather situational

### Tanya

* despro - 2022-06-02: oh and make tanya 2 shot inf instead of 1 but i had been warned there are some proper tanya fanboys, fun unit but lmao that design
* dang_shot - 2022-06-02: i think cnc players like her but it seems like a lot of the players coming from other games arent fan of her design
* longley - 2022-06-02: I have made several test with 2 shots, its sounds good on paper but there is issues. like medics for instance working as a 100% counter to her
* i like men - 2022-06-02: You could just make her do 2 shots quick and then a delay. Anyway I'm not going to pick a side here, but if you decide to nerf her you should probably revert the cost increase
* despro - 2022-06-30: tanya stronk most annoying thing is the reliance on her, a lot of allies vs allies games feel like it all comes down to tanya snipes. and ye its just constant having to snipe her since it takes no time to rebuild her
* Pinkthoth - 2022-06-30: Tanya paradrop could work if you create a proxy actor that you build instead of Tanya. I wonder if it would be possible to make Tanya buildable with delayed drop similiar to how vehicles are peoduced by Nod. It's also possible to create a cooldown for Tanya with a visual timer such as support powers have. I did that in my balance suggestions last year, but ppl who played it didn't like it


## Vehicles

### Ranger

* despro - 2022-06-02: increase hp of rangers
* i like men - 2022-06-02: Hopefully not a [buff to] vision

### Light Tank

* SarahSicaria - 2022-06-28: And in regards to allies not having anyway of dealing with aircraft early game, how would people feel about the LT having AA capabilities? Maybe the same damage as the flak but half the rate of fire so the DPS is less to compensate for it having more armor?
* Moods - 2022-06-28: Ill be honest the LT was the last thing i had in mind , not that its a bad idea i jus think it might actually be too good. Hinds and yaks   stuggle too kill them efficiently and they keep up with hinds speed wise so theres that
* netMan - 2022-07-06: maybe light tank can use a price reduction or armour damage increase. at this state its just a tanky flak truck that is alot less useful
* Gacius - 2022-07-06: Nope. Lt is good as it is
* Longley - 2022-07-06: im not sure its good as it.. besides early cheese and early oil game they are pretty much none existing. Making them more viable trough out the whole game would be nice, if possible. I agree they certaintly do not need a buff vs wood armor
* Pun - 2022-07-06: I think LT standalone can be buffed in 2 ways, buff against wood and heavy armour. Not as drastic as I did in the LV revamp but the buff should still be pretty significant. if not standalone, then I think LV's should grant 1 cell more vision and cost a little less. for them to be actually comparable to other later options, cause now there's not even a contest
* Longley - 2022-07-06: I think wood armour is a bit dangerous for early cheese. but Heavy armor i think could could be a good buff. we are testing that next balance test
* i like men - 2022-07-06: I don't know, despro seems to do a lot of non cheese LT builds. I'm not necessarily opposed to adjusting them but don't think they are as weak/irrelevant as you do
* .won - 2022-07-06: i just dont see anything to gain by buffing them, especially since they are an early game unit. You open it up to having crazy LT rush builds.
* Sara Sicaria - 2022-07-07: dont touch the light tank, its in a good spot.

### Mobile Flak

* Pun - 2022-07-06: I think we should also double mobile flak anti-heavy 10 -> 20. it wouldn't be much. but makes the unit feel better vs units like apc
* Longley - 2022-07-06: also have an effect on light tank/flak relationship.. but its so low that im not sure it makes a difference

### Medium Tank

* dang_shot - 2022-06-02: we should implement the small cost increase to medium tanks that bain balance pushed for a long time ago but never got around to, the change but be felt directly by players but it makes the hp/cost more even for medium and heavy tanks and there were some concern from a few players that mediums were better. i think this change is just a formality that should have been added back when the hp of mediums were reduced to 46000 from 47000 (after being increased from 45000)

### MCV

* Sara Sicaria - 2022-07-07: Whatever happened to reducing the MCV cost to $1600 btw? because iirc the MCV build time is boosted to be built in the equivalent time of a $1600 unit right? and its the only unit left with boosted build time right?
* Unano - 2022-07-07: Does sound like a good change
* Longley - 2022-07-07: I dont have any problems with testing that again, Unless theres any objections?.... Anjew?
* tux - 2022-07-07: I mean I'm not for or against the change really. it would make things more consistent and give you a bit more money but I don't see anything wrong with it currently

### Artillery

* dang_shot - 2022-06-02: punsho tested a more mobile artillery with less range, i dont know the exact numbers but i think this was a good design, i think it has a positive impact on stalemates (allies vs allies) because it becomes a little easier to snipe them due to reduced range but also it makes the unit feel better to control for the player

### Mobile Radar Jammer

* Sigil - 2022-07-01: Naturally saccing yaks to kill MRJ is worth too
* Pun - 2022-07-01: Problem is that yaks do quite pathetic damage to mrj. So you need to sack a ton
* .won - 2022-07-01: yeah i agree mrj armor is kinda insane. especially to yaks
* dang_shot - 2022-07-01: we have talked before about making it light armor before maybe we should try to test it. i agree that it can be bit awkward to snipe
* Pun - 2022-07-01: IMO mrj is fine as is, I'd rather we focus on more interesting / important balance changes
* Sarah Sicaria - 2022-07-01: I think it should be left alone
* despro - 2022-07-01: dont touch jammers pls
* Sigil - 2022-07-01: I think it's fine as is balance wise. Design, it feels really frustrating to have your army doing no damage because you can't snipe one unit

### Phase Transport

* dang_shot - 2022-06-02: someone suggested making phase transport a little stronger in combat and i think i would like to see that too, just need to be very careful not to overtune it because of the stealth
* Ekanim - 2022-07-06: Making LTs + Flaks have some range of stealth detection for phase tanks. Maybe changing phase armor to resemble TTs, if flaks and LTs aren’t already a good counter. This increases the purpose of these vehicles in late game, which can already be used for artillery flanks and anti-TT. The balance of the phase might need to be changed to increase its use after this nerf. Possible one or both: -increased vision to help avoid the new threat and be a late game multipurpose scout -increase the damage/capabilities of the weapon, making a group of them good for eco raids or even attacking out-of-position armor units. (I think this is going to be in the next release anyway)
* Pun - 2022-07-06: It has 7 cells of range, which is the same as ranger, highest vision vehicle in the game. Phase is currently broken on release but it's fine on balance maps
* .won - 2022-07-06: yeah I agree, i dont think we need to do anything, Phase transport is very niche, 1 faction gets it. It unclocks when unloading, and you are either using it to drop off something in a base, which usually have static d, or bringing it onto the field with tanya. Inf have 1 cell detection already.
* Blackened - 2022-07-06: Infantry detection is completely unreliable. Needs like a half cell increase at least. \[Image showing dogs vs thieves\]
* Longley - 2022-07-06: I agree with Mint. i do think more things should have stealth detection. and i also wouldn't mind if it had other use cases then just being transport

### Mobile Gap Generator

* Moods - 2022-06-30: While we are at it when are we going too tackle mgg... heres an idea.. have it replace radar jammer for england  entirely.. make it slightly cheaper then RJ and have it have the jammer AND shroud effect
* i like men - 2022-06-30: Don't think it makes much sense to make it cheaper on top of it. Especially not since RJ are already built often
* Pun - 2022-06-30: Just just buff shroud radius by 1 cell. For both mgg and gg

### Chronotank

* Orb - 2022-07-06: I'd rather see Chronotank get some attention than phase transport
* tux - 2022-07-06: Well we could make it fire even if it’s facing backwards. Then give the missiles more turn speed and a bit more range
* Orb - 2022-07-06: giving it some firing tolerance might not be crazy
* Blackened - 2022-07-07: chrono tanks are actually pretty decent. The just get countered pretty good by tesla tanks, and air to a certain extent. They're biggest problem is they get completely shut down by mrj. But so does any tracked missile.
* Mees - 2022-07-07: Their ability to splash infantry is both good an fun to use
* Moods - 2022-07-07: I think biggest issue is there light armor. Id like too see heavy armor cronotanks tht have AA capability, but a big damage nerf and cost incresse
* Orb - 2022-07-07: Teleporting AA units not exactly the easiest to balance. Light armor grants resistance to anti-heavy damage, it's not necessarily bad
You could always increase their health if that is the main concern

### Mammoths

* upps - 2022-06-02: Depends on the Match up I think their AA is often to good to stop them with airforce special with longbows. Allies struggle more then Soviets. And without own tier 3 they are really in a bad spot. In a SvS I often questioning, if you even should go for Mammoths because HT are often the better choice
* Mees - 2022-06-02: I think the limited speed really degrades the mammoth usefullness due to ever growing map size in 1v1 maps. In XvsX theyre very good
* Pun - 2022-06-02: I'd like 1 thing to happen, for mammoths to lose the ability to one-shot yaks. That can be done either by slightly decreasing anti-light damage or increasing yak health. Apart from that, mammoth rework could be reducing the cost of mammoth (perhaps to 1700) and decreasing anti-heavy accordingly
* dang_shot - 2022-06-02: i think mammoths are fine, dont think i would change them at the moment. actually pun's idea isnt that bad
* Longely - 2022-06-02: like bassicly mammuths have insane turnspeed compared to its size lol, so it forces the turret off target when retreating.. and other then looking ridiculess also means you loose target
* Orb - 2022-06-02: I'd like mammoths to get some of their range back. They were fun to micro but got nerfed into the ground. If you have to compensate by lowering their HP or something, so be it
* i like men - 2022-06-02: Hm I have to disagree with that, I really did not like their long range personally. I felt the tusk missiles gave too much control
* despro - 2022-06-30: theyre fine imo
* Moods - 2022-06-30: i think mammoths cud use a change they just seem so underwhelming these days. What i was gunna say was decrease AA tusk range and increase anti INF tusk range by a bit
* Pun - 2022-06-30: that range cannot be increased. It was super broken when it was longer
* i like men - 2022-06-30: Mammoths are performing pretty well Moods (based on RAGL stats at least). I don't think reworking them is a terrible idea, but I would definitely also be against reverting tusk range nerf. The range was absurd before in my opinion
* Sigil - 2022-06-30: On mammoths, they do feel a bit underwhelming but they were busted a few releases ago. I'd actually like to see the turret rotation speed. increased over anything else, they don't feel very microable. increasing tusk range would make them oppressive in soviet mirrors I think
* Orb - 2022-06-30: Mammoths aren't that good in Soviet mirrors, they just die to heavy tanks. I mean you can still mix them in, but spamming them wasn't good, even at their peak

### Demo Truck

* i like men - 2022-06-02: But I still have suggestions though. Like I still really want to reduce the radius of demo trucks. I think that should have been the nerf and not the hp change

### MAD Tank

* Longley - 2022-06-02: i think its good to add in regardless of knowing exactly what at the current moment. the madtank potential is pretty good in itself imo
* Pun - 2022-06-02: I don't think we should do anything with mad tank. As a concept is just is not fun. It's a poor man's demo truck
* Longley - 2022-06-02: the main difference between madtank and demo is that demo is usefull against army, and very rarely buildings. where madtanks sucks vs army but are semi good vs buildings, making them good was army kinda does make them a demo truck clone
* Mees - 2022-06-02: I think theres no way to balance mad tanks without making them OP in chokey team games. Unless chronoing becomes impossible or smt like that

### Tesla Tank

* Blackened - 2022-06-02: tesla tanks need less vision. change it to the same as every other tank besides ranger/phase. and air is pretty easily countered considering tesla tanks would give flaks full aa range
* Longley - 2022-06-02: isnt that kinda what makes them different? i know its super good. but.. it also sucks to have all units feel the same
* Pun - 2022-06-02: we will have to touch tesla tank at some point. It's crushing just has to go
* Orb - 2022-06-02: Crushing would not be an issue if IC didn't exist


## Air

### Yaks

* despro - 2022-06-27: they are still bonkers at times now but just wish their behaviour was more consistent if it requires a slight nerf then so be it
* Longley - 2022-06-27: yaks vs infantry have been discussed many times, as punsho said main problem is lack of alied mobile AA, which people also tried to solve many times
* despro - 2022-06-27: when a-moving they sometimes strafe whole blob other time just attack 1
* Longley - 2022-06-27: nah, they dont really have strafing mechanics. they shoot the same target till its dead
* Pun - 2022-06-27: They just can't be consistent vs infantry
* ilikemen - 2022-06-27: Of course you can make them more consistent if you nerf them Pun. We should just consider exploring the strafing again, pretty sure this was always the plan but we weren't sure how to nerf it. I think we could revisit that
* Pun - 2022-06-27: It's likely just yak aquiring a target that it can't kill in the strafe it's currently doing. The problem was that we want yak to be a sniper
* ilikemen - 2022-06-27: Oh that's true I remember - needs to be able to snipe arties and tanya
* Orb - 2022-06-27: Don't change the Yak/V2 interaction. You'd be smoothing out yet another interesting wrinkle
* ilikemen - 2022-06-27: I'm not saying to change anything, I'm just giving examples of why it is unreliable
* Longley - 2022-06-27: yeah i guess inconsistent and unreliable also isnt the same thing
* Blackened - 2022-06-27: Yaks have 2 guns. Sometimes only 1 gun is in range so they dong deliver the damage they should
* Ekanim - 2022-06-27: Why not give yaks 1 gun?
* Orb - 2022-06-27: The attack weapon is completely changed from RA so it doesn't really matter how we change
* Sigil - 2022-06-27: would like to see \[strafing] back with less damage to infantry while still retaining the ability to snipe a tanya
* SarahSicaria - 2022-06-28: I definitely agree about the yak is very inconsistent. Its another reason why i dont play soviets. I wouldnt mind seeing opportunity fire reintroduced with certain nerfs to stop it from being OP, maybe reduced speed + cost increase to 1500


## Support Powers

### Parabombs

* Blackened - 2022-06-02: parabombs should also kill a tanya if they miss by 1 cell.

### Iron Curtain

* despro - 2022-06-03: u guys talked about ic earlier so just curious and this might be a tux tier idea, but what if u changed ic to a 2x2 square? this could be a small nerf since 1 less tank plus it would make it easier to hit a moving tank, think its a tad annoying to target moving tanks at least
* i like men - 2022-06-03: it's not the worst idea, but could be I am missing something
* Blackened - 2022-06-03: i wouldnt find that nerf to ic but that doesn't really do much. besides the 5 ic apc/tesla crush it really only take 1 tank to route an army
* .won - 2022-06-03: the net code fix prob will solve a lot of issues
