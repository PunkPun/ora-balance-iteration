# BI-4.0 Planning

Discussion about balance going into BI-4.0.


## General

### Scaling

* dang_shot - 2022-06-02: the scaling changes, i dont want to list specific numbers but i think we could touch scaling too

### Bullet Speed

* i like men - 2022-06-02: I would definitely not add bullet speed to rifles. I don't think it would improve any interactions and I think it would be rather annoying
* dang_shot - 2022-06-02: bullet speed for rifles would not be good with how movement and subcell works. if damage is consistent in infantry vs infantry, then i think i would be fine with testing it now we have the facing changes
* Longley - 2022-06-02: i wasnt planning to add it to anything, since it would be very controversial. but its no secret im not a fan of the bullet speed removal

### Crushing

* Pinkthoth - 2022-06-02: I think RA would benefit from including CA's feature where vehicles slow down when they are crushing infantry
* Blackened - 2022-06-02: I'd be okay with that but maybe not such a hard slowdown
* Duke Bones - 2022-06-02: But what about those NASTY early game LV crushes smh
* Gacius - 2022-06-02: that is annoying and shouldnt exist
* tux - 2022-06-02: I hate thohse. complete rng


## Defences

### Base Defences

* dang_shot - 2022-06-02: i dont think base defences have been that dominant this season (but maybe players disagree?), but i still think pill box is overperforming a little. Punsho tested a pretty big increase in reload delay some time back and seemed like it worked pretty well, so i think we should nerf pill box a little by increasing reload delay
* i like men - 2022-06-02: adding a new armor type for base defences. I know back then Pun made the argument that it would probably be better for us to work with what we already had and I don't disagree with that, but seeing as TD has now done it too I actually think we should really consider doing it here as well becuase it does give us more freedom
* dang_shot - 2022-06-02: oo thats a good one. i really think we should do that now td has done it too
* Pun - 2022-06-02: Before changing their armour type, we should consider what do we actually want to do with it. I can think of only 2 potentially worthwhile changes: tanks do less damage to defences. aircraft do less damage to defences. well, another one could be a big reduction to anti-inf defence damage, and also reduction in rocket soldier damage to defences. When it comes to artillery I do think arty needs to have a bit higher anti-defence damage. But that change doesn't require a new armour type at all
* Upps - 2022-06-02: About adding concrete Armor for defences im a fan of that. -making tanks a lot better against defences. -making BH/Yak a lot worse against defences. I would exclude Migs and Longbows for this. -making rocket Soldier worse to defences.

### Gap Generator

* Pun - 2022-06-02: I think gap generation could receive a +1 cell range buff


## Infantry

### Flamers

* i like men - 2022-06-02: It's no secret that I wanted to rework flamer or grenadier, but seeing how well despro has been using flamers I would kind of just like to leave them alone for now
* Longely - 2022-06-02: yeah, i was actually planning to rework the flammer a bit. but despro kinda proved they allready are pretty usefull in the cases i wanted it to be good in.

### Grenadiers

* tux - 2022-06-02: oh yeah how about removing chain explosions from grens
* Gacius - 2022-06-03: if dog ate a grenadier, should dog explode as well from death damage of gren?
* Pun - 2022-06-03: I'm not sure what grenades you've seen people eat, but they defo shouldn't detonate

### Tanya

* despro - 2022-06-02: oh and make tanya 2 shot inf instead of 1 but i had been warned there are some proper tanya fanboys, fun unit but lmao that design
* dang_shot - 2022-06-02: i think cnc players like her but it seems like a lot of the players coming from other games arent fan of her design
* longley - 2022-06-02: I have made several test with 2 shots, its sounds good on paper but there is issues. like medics for instance working as a 100% counter to her
* i like men - 2022-06-02: You could just make her do 2 shots quick and then a delay. Anyway I'm not going to pick a side here, but if you decide to nerf her you should probably revert the cost increase


## Vehicles

### Ranger

* despro - 2022-06-02: increase hp of rangers
* i like men - 2022-06-02: Hopefully not a [buff to] vision

### Medium Tank

* dang_shot - 2022-06-02: we should implement the small cost increase to medium tanks that bain balance pushed for a long time ago but never got around to, the change but be felt directly by players but it makes the hp/cost more even for medium and heavy tanks and there were some concern from a few players that mediums were better. i think this change is just a formality that should have been added back when the hp of mediums were reduced to 46000 from 47000 (after being increased from 45000)

### Artillery

* dang_shot - 2022-06-02: punsho tested a more mobile artillery with less range, i dont know the exact numbers but i think this was a good design, i think it has a positive impact on stalemates (allies vs allies) because it becomes a little easier to snipe them due to reduced range but also it makes the unit feel better to control for the player

### Phase Transport

* dang_shot - 2022-06-02: someone suggested making phase transport a little stronger in combat and i think i would like to see that too, just need to be very careful not to overtune it because of the stealth

### Mammoths

* upps - 2022-06-02: Depends on the Match up I think their AA is often to good to stop them with airforce special with longbows. Allies struggle more then Soviets. And without own tier 3 they are really in a bad spot. In a SvS I often questioning, if you even should go for Mammoths because HT are often the better choice
* Mees - 2022-06-02: I think the limited speed really degrades the mammoth usefullness due to ever growing map size in 1v1 maps. In XvsX theyre very good
* Pun - 2022-06-02: I'd like 1 thing to happen, for mammoths to lose the ability to one-shot yaks. That can be done either by slightly decreasing anti-light damage or increasing yak health. Apart from that, mammoth rework could be reducing the cost of mammoth (perhaps to 1700) and decreasing anti-heavy accordingly
* dang_shot - 2022-06-02: i think mammoths are fine, dont think i would change them at the moment. actually pun's idea isnt that bad
* Longely - 2022-06-02: like bassicly mammuths have insane turnspeed compared to its size lol, so it forces the turret off target when retreating.. and other then looking ridiculess also means you loose target
* Orb - 2022-06-02: I'd like mammoths to get some of their range back. They were fun to micro but got nerfed into the ground. If you have to compensate by lowering their HP or something, so be it
* i like men - 2022-06-02: Hm I have to disagree with that, I really did not like their long range personally. I felt the tusk missiles gave too much control

### Demo Truck

* i like men - 2022-06-02: But I still have suggestions though. Like I still really want to reduce the radius of demo trucks. I think that should have been the nerf and not the hp change

### MAD Tank

* Longley - 2022-06-02: i think its good to add in regardless of knowing exactly what at the current moment. the madtank potential is pretty good in itself imo
* Pun - 2022-06-02: I don't think we should do anything with mad tank. As a concept is just is not fun. It's a poor man's demo truck
* Longley - 2022-06-02: the main difference between madtank and demo is that demo is usefull against army, and very rarely buildings. where madtanks sucks vs army but are semi good vs buildings, making them good was army kinda does make them a demo truck clone
* Mees - 2022-06-02: I think theres no way to balance mad tanks without making them OP in chokey team games. Unless chronoing becomes impossible or smt like that

### Tesla Tank

* Blackened - 2022-06-02: tesla tanks need less vision. change it to the same as every other tank besides ranger/phase. and air is pretty easily countered considering tesla tanks would give flaks full aa range
* Longley - 2022-06-02: isnt that kinda what makes them different? i know its super good. but.. it also sucks to have all units feel the same
* Pun - 2022-06-02: we will have to touch tesla tank at some point. It's crushing just has to go
* Orb - 2022-06-02: Crushing would not be an issue if IC didn't exist


## Support Powers

### Parabombs

* Blackened - 2022-06-02: parabombs should also kill a tanya if they miss by 1 cell.

### Iron Curtain

* despro - 2022-06-03: u guys talked about ic earlier so just curious and this might be a tux tier idea, but what if u changed ic to a 2x2 square? this could be a small nerf since 1 less tank plus it would make it easier to hit a moving tank, think its a tad annoying to target moving tanks at least
* i like men - 2022-06-03: it's not the worst idea, but could be I am missing something
* Blackened - 2022-06-03: i wouldnt find that nerf to ic but that doesn't really do much. besides the 5 ic apc/tesla crush it really only take 1 tank to route an army
* .won - 2022-06-03: the net code fix prob will solve a lot of issues
